Thanks to JSDELIVR(https://www.jsdelivr.com/)! It makes possible to let me own free cdn service,and I have to say

it's really useful and convenient for me!


Simple Usage Demo:

Say that, If we put `logo.png` in the folder of `images` in this repo,then we can magically get the cdn url of the following:

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/johnyang1210/mystaticfiles@latest/images/logo.png

```
